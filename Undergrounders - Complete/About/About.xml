V1.6

The complete version of all my Undergrounders mods to date, with any new standalone versions also being updated here! This mod requires both DLCs to function properly, and currently contains:

 - Anticillin, a new mold-based antibiotic.
 - Darklight, adding darklight/fungus fueled versions of campfires and a fungus fueled brazier.
 - Deep Fabrics, two new plants that produce cloth and a fungus-based leather.
 - Gelapathy, a new medicinal fungus that, when combined with insect jelly, produces effective medicine.
 - Ghostwort and Glowstool, a new underground decorative plant.
 - Mortuary, including two new uses for skulls and a new building, the tomb, which lets you bury pawns within the walls.
 - Plantable Timbershroom, making the already present timbershroom plantable with the tree sowing research.

Important: Please unsubscribe from all the mods listed above if you plan on installing this one.

As of 1.6, the compatibility patch for Vanilla Memes Expanded is no longer included in this mod, as it would force this entire mod to use Harmony. For compatibility, it is now a separate mod.
