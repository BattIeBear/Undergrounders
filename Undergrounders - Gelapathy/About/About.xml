V1.6

This mod adds a new plant, ameliorum, a bioengineered mushroom which is used to create two new types of medicine: bioGel and regeneGel.

BioGel is made by mixing ameliorum and insect jelly, and regeneGel is made with ameliorum, insect jelly, and neutroamine. BioGel and regeneGel are roughly equivalent to herbal medicine and industrial medicine respectively, though will rot quickly if not chilled.

Both of these are produced at the drug lab, but regeneGel requires medicine production to be researched first.
